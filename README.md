At the moment only the .js and .wasm files generated by emscripten work as es6
modules in node and the browser.

There has been attempts to bundle these files in a higher level js class for
convenience, but this doesn't work when trying to bundle say a vue application
that consumes the bundled library, it looks like the wasm is not found when
webpack is being run twice.

`webpack.config.js`, `js/node.index.js` and `browser.index.js` files are kept
here for reference and future attempts.

`webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env` and
`babel-loader` dev modules should be installed to run new bundling attempts. 

The solution might be to write a custom wasm loading JS code.
For now the api generated by embind is sufficient.
